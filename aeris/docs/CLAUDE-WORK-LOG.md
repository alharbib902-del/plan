## Task

Phase 3.5.1: Branch Protection Ops

## Status

Completed (ready for Codex review).

This is a documentation-only follow-on to Phase 3.5. No app code, no
dependency changes, no workflow YAML changes. The deliverable is a
new "Branch Protection Setup" section inside the existing
`docs/checklists/ci-pipeline.md`.

## Summary

Phase 3.5 made CI runnable. Phase 3.5.1 makes CI **load-bearing** —
i.e., a red CI run physically prevents merge to `main`. That requires
a Branch Protection rule on `main`, which can only be configured
*after* the first push and *after* the first CI run gives GitHub a
status-check name to bind to. Phase 3.5.1 captures that procedure
precisely so the founder can run it once without guesswork.

## What Claude did NOT do

These are explicitly founder actions and were intentionally not
performed in this session:

- **Did not push to `origin`.** The push is the founder's call,
  including which exact commit set lands first. The repo is at
  `https://github.com/alharbib902-del/plan.git`; `origin/main` is at
  commit `6248a60` ("Add Aeris private aviation pitch deck"); the
  Aeris project files (`aeris/`, `.github/`, etc.) are still
  untracked locally. The founder decides when those are committed
  and pushed.
- **Did not configure the Branch Protection rule on GitHub.** That is
  a server-side operation against the GitHub API/UI, not a file in
  the repo.
- **Did not run the Verification PR.** That requires push + a real PR
  on GitHub; it is documented as a step the founder runs once after
  enabling the rule.

What Claude did do is document the entire procedure end-to-end so the
founder can run it without ambiguity, with both UI and `gh` CLI
paths, and with a clear Verification step that proves the rule is
live.

## Files Changed

### Edited

- `aeris/docs/checklists/ci-pipeline.md` — appended one new section
  **"Branch Protection Setup"** *after* the existing
  `Steps`, `Pass criteria`, and `If it fails` sections. The new
  section contains five sub-sections:
  1. **Push prerequisite** — six-step pre-push checklist (clean
     working tree, preflight passes, accepted-commit confirmation,
     `git push origin main`, watching the first CI run, fixing red
     before configuring the rule).
  2. **Setup via GitHub UI** — exact navigation
     (`/settings/branches`), exact toggle names matching GitHub's
     current labels (e.g. "Do not allow bypassing the above
     settings" — the renamed-from "Include administrators" toggle),
     exact text to type into the status-check search box
     (`Type-check, build, lint`).
  3. **Setup via `gh` CLI** — copy-pasteable `gh api -X PUT ...`
     invocation with full JSON body (`required_status_checks.strict
     = true`, `enforce_admins: true`, `required_linear_history:
     true`, `allow_force_pushes: false`, `allow_deletions: false`,
     `required_approving_review_count: 0`).
  4. **Verification** — concrete steps for a fake PR with a one-line
     TypeScript error, the exact UI signal that proves the rule
     blocks merge, and the mandatory cleanup (close PR, delete
     branch).
  5. **What this rule does and does not block** — a 9-row matrix
     covering merge-while-red, stale-branch merges, force-push,
     deletion, direct push, founder self-bypass, second-contributor
     review, new workflow contexts, and `npm audit` gating.
  6. **Activation record** — a fill-in block (date, by-whom, status
     check name, setup method, verification PR URL) that the founder
     completes once and that future Codex iterations can audit.

### Not edited

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — frozen from Phase 3.5; Phase 3.5.1
  authorizes no changes to the workflow YAML.
- `aeris/package.json`, `aeris/package-lock.json` — no dependency
  changes.
- `aeris/scripts/preflight.ps1` — frozen.
- `aeris/docs/security/npm-audit-triage.md` — frozen.
- `aeris/docs/checklists/README.md` — no change required; the new
  setup section is purely additive inside `ci-pipeline.md` and the
  index entry already points readers there.
- `aeris/docs/checklists/production-readiness.md` — no change. The
  master gate already references `ci-pipeline.md` as Step 5; the new
  Branch Protection Setup is one-time setup (not a recurring
  pre-deploy gate), so it lives inside the linked file rather than
  being lifted into the recurring master list.
- Other checklist files — no changes.
- Source under `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `types/`, `supabase/` —
  not touched.

## Commands the founder will run

These are **founder actions**, not Claude actions. Captured here so
Codex iteration N+1 has them on hand.

### Push prerequisite

```powershell
# From D:\Plan
git status                                # working tree clean, on main
pwsh aeris\scripts\preflight.ps1          # local quality gates green
git log -1 --oneline                      # confirm HEAD is the accepted commit
git push origin main                      # first push of Phase 1-3.5 work
# Then open: https://github.com/alharbib902-del/plan/actions
# and wait for the CI run to finish.
```

### Branch Protection (UI route)

```
Open: https://github.com/alharbib902-del/plan/settings/branches
→ Branch protection rules → Add rule
→ Branch name pattern: main
→ (toggle as documented in ci-pipeline.md → Branch Protection Setup → Setup via GitHub UI)
→ Create
```

### Branch Protection (`gh` CLI route, equivalent)

```bash
# After: gh auth login (with admin:repo scope)
gh api -X PUT \
  "repos/alharbib902-del/plan/branches/main/protection" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  --input - <<'JSON'
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": ["Type-check, build, lint"]
  },
  "enforce_admins": true,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "required_approving_review_count": 0,
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": false
  },
  "restrictions": null,
  "required_linear_history": true,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false
}
JSON
```

### Verification PR

```
Branch: verify/protection-rule
Change: a one-line TypeScript error (see ci-pipeline.md → Verification)
Expected on the PR page:
  - "Type-check, build, lint" check is ✗ red
  - Merge button disabled with "Required statuses must pass before merging"
Cleanup: close PR, delete branch locally and remotely
```

## GitHub URLs the founder will visit

- **Workflow runs:** `https://github.com/alharbib902-del/plan/actions`
- **CI workflow page:** `https://github.com/alharbib902-del/plan/actions/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Branch protection settings:** `https://github.com/alharbib902-del/plan/settings/branches`
- **New rule form:** `https://github.com/alharbib902-del/plan/settings/branch_protection_rules/new`

## Open Question Decisions (from `docs/CLAUDE-TASK.md`)

1. **Linear history?** — **Yes.** `required_linear_history: true`
   baked into both UI procedure (Step 6) and `gh` CLI body. Solo
   founder workflow benefits from a clean rebased history.
2. **Include administrators (now "Do not allow bypassing")?** —
   **Yes.** `enforce_admins: true` baked in. The founder is the
   admin; carving the founder out defeats the rule.
3. **Required PR reviews?** — **No, set to 0.** Solo founder. A
   `TODO` is captured in the matrix (`What this rule does and does
   not block`) noting that a second contributor changes this answer.
4. **Signed commits?** — **Deferred.** Not part of Phase 3.5.1.
5. **UI screenshots?** — **No.** Text-only. GitHub's settings page
   is redesigned periodically; field names in text are the most
   stable form.

## Acceptance Criteria — Self-Audit

Cross-checked against `docs/CLAUDE-TASK.md` "Acceptance Criteria":

1. **Branch Protection Setup section exists** in `ci-pipeline.md`
   with all four required sub-sections. ✓
   - Prerequisites: present (Push prerequisite, 6 items).
   - GitHub UI procedure: present (10 toggles, exact field names).
   - `gh` CLI procedure: present (full JSON body, copy-pasteable).
   - Verification: present (deliberate TS error → expected UI
     signal → cleanup).

2. **Both procedures concrete:** ✓
   - UI procedure names every screen, every toggle (matches current
     GitHub labels including the renamed "Do not allow bypassing"
     toggle), and the exact status-check string.
   - `gh` CLI procedure is copy-pasteable with explicit caveats
     about owner/repo substitution and required token scope.

3. **Verification step concrete:** ✓
   - Exact change to introduce: `const _verify: number = "..."`.
   - Exact UI signal: red ✗ next to `Type-check, build, lint` and
     a disabled merge button with the exact message text.
   - Cleanup: close PR, delete branch locally + remotely.

4. **Pre-push checklist** at top of section. ✓ (6 items.)

5. **Founder-action lines in this work log:** ✓
   - "What Claude did NOT do" section names the three deferred
     founder actions explicitly.
   - "Commands the founder will run" captures the exact CLI.
   - "GitHub URLs" lists every page.
   - The Activation record block in `ci-pipeline.md` is the fill-in
     line for the founder to complete on activation.

6. **Scope discipline:** ✓
   - No dependency changes.
   - No app code changes.
   - No workflow YAML changes.
   - No new files anywhere.
   - No Phase 3.6 or Phase 4 work started.

## Commands Run And Results

Phase 3.5.1 only edits documentation. The Phase 3.5 quality gates
were already green at the moment Phase 3.5 was accepted (100/100,
2026-05-04, Codex iteration 2). Documentation-only edits do not
invalidate those results, so the gates were not re-run a third time.

If Codex prefers a fresh confirmation run on the final repo state:

```bash
cd aeris
npm run type-check   # expected: exit 0
npm run build        # expected: exit 0, admin routes ƒ Dynamic
npm run lint:strict  # expected: exit 0, "✔ No ESLint warnings or errors"
```

`npm ci` and `npm audit --json` do not need to be re-run because the
lockfile is byte-identical to Phase 3.5.

## Known Issues

- **Activation gap.** Until the founder completes the founder-action
  steps (push, configure rule, verify), CI is technically running
  the gates but is *not* gating merges. Phase 3.5.1 documents the
  procedure; activation is the founder's next step. The Activation
  record block in `ci-pipeline.md` is intentionally blank to make
  this gap visible.

- **Status check name fragility.** The required-status-check name
  `Type-check, build, lint` comes from the `name:` field on the
  `quality-gates` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. If that `name:`
  is ever changed, the Branch Protection rule will silently stop
  matching (CI runs, but the rule allows merge because no required
  context resolves). Mitigation: the workflow YAML has been frozen
  since Phase 3.5; any future change to it should automatically
  trigger a re-read of `ci-pipeline.md` Step 1 (which already
  enforces this discipline as part of the recurring checklist).

- **`gh` CLI auth scope.** The `gh api -X PUT
  /repos/.../branches/main/protection` call requires the founder's
  `gh` token to have `admin:repo` scope. Captured in the procedure;
  not a Claude action.

- **No Dependabot, no signed commits.** Both deferred — not in
  Phase 3.5.1 scope. Mention here only so Codex sees they were
  deliberately not added.

## Questions For Codex

None of these are blockers for Phase 3.5.1 acceptance:

1. **Should an "after activation" recurring check be added to
   `production-readiness.md`?** Today, that file references
   `ci-pipeline.md` (Step 5) and the Branch Protection setup is
   one-time. Once activated, the only ongoing check is "rule still
   exists, still binds to the right context name." Recommendation:
   a single line in `production-readiness.md` Step 5 — "rule binds
   to `Type-check, build, lint` and `enforce_admins: true`" — would
   close that audit loop. Want me to add it in a follow-up tiny
   task, or fold into the next phase?

2. **`@sentry/nextjs` decision (Phase 3.6).** Still open from
   Phase 3.5 questions. The Phase 3.5.1 work doesn't change the
   answer; flagging it again so it doesn't get lost.

3. **Phase 4 readiness.** With Phase 3.5.1 ready for review, the
   operational scaffolding around the accepted Phase 1-3
   deliverables is feature-complete: CI, audit triage, preflight,
   branch protection procedure, all six checklists. The next
   natural step is Phase 4 (minimal operator portal). Confirm or
   pivot.

Stopped after Phase 3.5.1. Did not start Phase 3.6 or Phase 4.

## Founder activation chain (2026-05-04)

After Codex accepted Phase 3.5.1 at 98/100, the founder dispatched
the operational activation chain documented in
`docs/checklists/ci-pipeline.md` → "Branch Protection Setup". Five
of the seven steps completed live on GitHub before the founder
paused the chain. This section is the ground-truth record so a
future reader does not assume "all founder actions deferred" when
half the chain is in fact already in production effect.

### What actually completed on GitHub

| # | Step | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|:-:|---|
| 1 | Preflight (type-check + build + lint:strict) | ✅ Done | All three gates green locally. |
| 2 | Local commit | ✅ Done | `920491d Add Aeris MVP through Phase 3.5.1` (71 files, no secrets, no `node_modules`, no `.next`, no `*.tsbuildinfo`). |
| 3 | Push to `origin/main` | ✅ Done | `6248a60..920491d  main -> main`. After a credential switch from inactive `basem902` to active `alharbib902-del` via `gh auth switch -u alharbib902-del` and `gh auth setup-git`. No `--force`. No remote URL change. |
| 4 | First CI run | ✅ Done — green | Run id `25301539527`, duration 57 s. Job name `Type-check, build, lint`. All steps green: Set up job → Checkout → Set up Node.js 20 → Install dependencies (clean) → Type-check → Build → Lint (strict) → Post → Complete. (One non-blocking annotation about Node 20 actions deprecating to Node 24 in June 2026 — not affecting Phase 3.5.1.) |
| 5 | Branch Protection rule on `main` | ✅ Done | Enabled via `gh api -X PUT repos/alharbib902-del/plan/branches/main/protection` with the JSON body documented in `ci-pipeline.md`. GitHub response confirms: `required_status_checks.strict = true`, `contexts = ["Type-check, build, lint"]` (auto-mapped to `app_id: 15368` = GitHub Actions), `enforce_admins.enabled = true`, `required_linear_history.enabled = true`, `allow_force_pushes.enabled = false`, `allow_deletions.enabled = false`, `required_approving_review_count = 0`. |

### What the founder deferred (then completed in a follow-on round)

| # | Step | Status | Founder note |
|---|---|:-:|---|
| 6 | Verification PR (intentional fail → confirm merge blocked) | ✅ **Completed 2026-05-04 (follow-on round)** — see "Phase 3.5.1 Verification PR run" section below. |
| 7 | Activation record fill-in inside `ci-pipeline.md` | ✅ **Completed 2026-05-04 (follow-on round)** — see "Phase 3.5.1 Verification PR run" section below. |

### Founder decision (corrected for accuracy after first pass)

The founder's first framing of the pause used the phrase "GitHub
activation deferred", which on second reading was inaccurate — by
the time the pause was issued, push, the first green CI run, and
the Branch Protection rule were already live on GitHub and could
not be "deferred" retrospectively. The correct framing, as the
founder restated it for the record:

> "GitHub activation completed جزئيًا: push + first green CI +
> Branch Protection تمّت. المؤجل فقط هو Verification PR وملء
> Activation record."

What this means in plain operational terms: CI is running on every
PR and push to `main`; Branch Protection is enforcing the
`Type-check, build, lint` check, linear history, and admin-inclusive
non-bypass; the Verification PR (the empirical proof that a red CI
actually blocks merge end-to-end) and the Activation record fill-in
remain pending and must be completed before the first production
deploy.

### Residual risk at pause time — RESOLVED 2026-05-04

At pause time, the Verification PR was the empirical proof that
the rule actually blocked merge on red CI, and that proof did not
exist yet. Without it, we knew the rule was *configured* (the `gh
api` response was in this file above) but not that it *behaved*
the way the rule's JSON suggested. Two things followed:

1. **CI gating was presumed-working but unverified.** A future PR
   with red CI was *likely* to be blocked, but that had not been
   demonstrated end-to-end against this specific repo + rule
   combination.
2. **The Activation record in `ci-pipeline.md` was blank.** A
   future Codex iteration or auditor reading that fill-in block
   would correctly have concluded that empirical activation was
   incomplete.

### What MUST happen before any production deploy — SATISFIED 2026-05-04

> **Status update (2026-05-04):** both prerequisites below were
> completed in the follow-on round documented in
> **"Phase 3.5.1 Verification PR run (2026-05-04, follow-on
> round)"** later in this file. Production deploys are no longer
> blocked by this gate (other gates in
> `docs/checklists/production-readiness.md` still apply
> independently). The text below is the historical record of what
> the gate *required*.

`docs/checklists/production-readiness.md` Step 5 required
`ci-pipeline.md` to pass before deploy. The two deferred items
listed above had to be completed first:

1. Run the Verification PR exactly as documented in
   `ci-pipeline.md` → "Verification" (one-line TS error → push →
   PR → confirm red CI + disabled merge button → close PR → delete
   branch locally and on remote).
2. Fill the Activation record block with date, by-whom, status
   check name (`Type-check, build, lint`), setup method (`gh
   CLI`), and the verification PR URL after closing.

Until those two steps ran, production deploys remained blocked by
the existing checklist — not by Branch Protection being broken,
but by the founder-stated rule that operational checklists must
all be green before deploy. **As of 2026-05-04 both steps have
run; this gate is no longer outstanding.**

### Local repo state after pause

- On `main`, working tree clean, up to date with `origin/main`.
- Local commit `920491d` matches `origin/main` HEAD exactly.
- `verify/protection-rule` branch deleted locally; never existed on
  remote.
- No `--force` operation, no remote URL change, no credential write
  beyond the standard `gh auth switch` to an account that was
  already authenticated in the keyring.
- Untracked locally and intentionally not staged: `.claude/`,
  `advisor-doc/` (founder choice from earlier turn).

### Phase 4 readiness

Phase 4 (Minimal Operator Portal) can begin **locally** at any time
by founder dispatch. It must not be deployed to production until the
two deferred items above are run. That sequencing is the safe path
because:

- All Phase 4 commits will land on the same protected `main` via
  PRs that go through CI.
- The first PR after Phase 4 starts implicitly tests the protection
  rule (a green CI will allow merge; a red CI will block it). That
  PR will substitute for an explicit Verification PR if the founder
  prefers it that way — but the Activation record should still be
  filled out the first time merge is observed to be gated by CI
  status.

---

## Phase 3.5.1 Verification PR run (2026-05-04, follow-on round)

The two items deferred above (Verification PR + Activation record)
were completed in a dedicated follow-on round, before Phase 4
implementation begins. This section is the audit record.

### Goal

Empirically prove that the Branch Protection rule on `main` blocks
merge when the required status check (`Type-check, build, lint`) is
red, and fill the Activation record block in
`docs/checklists/ci-pipeline.md`.

### Procedure executed

1. **Created branch** `verify/protection-rule` from clean `main`
   (uncommitted iteration-4 doc changes were carried over to the
   working tree but never staged on this branch).
2. **Added one throwaway file** `aeris/lib/_verify-protection-rule.ts`
   containing a deliberate TypeScript error
   (`const _verify: number = "this should be a number, not a string";`).
   `git add` was scoped to that single path; the iteration-4 doc
   modifications stayed unstaged.
3. **Commit** `f8540db` —
   `verify: intentionally break type-check (Phase 3.5.1 Verification PR)`.
   One file changed, eight insertions.
4. **Pushed** to `origin/verify/protection-rule`.
5. **Opened PR** via `gh pr create` →
   [#1](https://github.com/alharbib902-del/plan/pull/1) titled
   `verify: Phase 3.5.1 protection-rule check (DO NOT MERGE)`.
6. **CI ran and failed** as expected. Run id `25302544403`,
   duration 32 s, job `Type-check, build, lint`. The Type-check
   step exited with code `2`, surfacing
   `Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.`. The Build
   and Lint steps were skipped.
7. **Verified merge was blocked** via
   `gh pr view 1 --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup`:
   ```json
   {
     "mergeable": "MERGEABLE",
     "mergeStateStatus": "BLOCKED",
     "statusCheckRollup": [{
       "name": "Type-check, build, lint",
       "workflowName": "CI",
       "conclusion": "FAILURE",
       "status": "COMPLETED"
     }]
   }
   ```
   `mergeStateStatus = "BLOCKED"` is GitHub's signal that the
   required status check is gating the merge button, even though
   the merge would mechanically apply (`mergeable = "MERGEABLE"`).
   That is the exact behaviour the Branch Protection rule was
   designed to produce.
8. **Closed PR #1** with `gh pr close 1 --comment "..."`. No
   merge.
9. **Deleted remote branch**:
   `git push origin --delete verify/protection-rule` →
   `[deleted] verify/protection-rule`.
10. **Switched back to** `main` and **deleted local branch**
    `verify/protection-rule` (was at `f8540db`). The throwaway
    file `aeris/lib/_verify-protection-rule.ts` was removed from
    the working tree by the checkout (it lived only on the verify
    branch and was never tracked on `main`).
11. **Filled Activation record** in
    `docs/checklists/ci-pipeline.md` → "Branch Protection
    Setup" → "Activation record":
    - Activated on: `2026-05-04`
    - Activated by: `alharbib902-del` (founder, via gh CLI)
    - Status check name: `Type-check, build, lint`
    - Setup method: `[x] gh CLI`
    - Verification PR URL: `https://github.com/alharbib902-del/plan/pull/1`
      (closed without merging)
    Plus a new "Empirical evidence captured at activation"
    sub-block with the failing CI run URL, the
    `mergeStateStatus = BLOCKED` snapshot, and the cleanup
    confirmation.

### What this round did NOT do

- No change to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- No change to `package.json` / `package-lock.json`.
- No `--force` push, no admin override, no bypass of the rule.
- No commit to `main` (the only commit was on the throwaway
  branch, and it never merged).
- No new dependency.
- No change to `aeris/docs/CLAUDE-TASK.md` (Phase 4 spec
  iteration 4 remains as Codex accepted it).
- No Phase 4 implementation work started.

### Final repo state after this round

- On `main`, working tree contains only the iteration-4
  modifications to `aeris/docs/CLAUDE-TASK.md` and
  `aeris/docs/CLAUDE-WORK-LOG.md` (the latter is being updated
  right now). These remain unstaged and uncommitted, awaiting the
  Phase 4 implementation PR.
- `origin/main` is unchanged from the last accepted commit
  `920491d Add Aeris MVP through Phase 3.5.1`.
- `git branch -a` shows only `main` and `remotes/origin/main`.
  The verify branch is gone from both sides.
- Branch Protection rule on `main` is still active, unchanged
  from when it was configured.
- The Activation record is now filled in. CI is officially
  load-bearing, with empirical proof.

### Follow-up

The Phase 4 acceptance criterion #23 (`The Phase 3.5.1
Verification PR was run and signed off in the Activation record
**before** this Phase 4 PR opened`) is now satisfiable. Phase 4
implementation can begin on a separate dispatch.
